Elements:

TODO: Replace "population" with development below.  Development is an abstration of population plus infrastructure, food production, industry, etc.

Turns:
======

* The game is turn-based.  Each turn consists of three phases: orders, movement, and combat.
* In the orders phase, all the choice of builds, ship movements, ship orders, etc., are done.  All players do the orders phase at the same time.
* After all players have hit the "turn" button, the movement phase begins.  Players watch as the moves are executed.
* Then begins the combat phase.  If friendly and enemy units end up in the same hex, combat is resolved there.  The only exceptions to this are: no side has attack capability; and N-1 or more sides are evading successfully.
* Combat is resolved for all hexes.  Combat must result in the destruction or retreat of at least N-1 sides.
* After all combats are resolved, each unit built during the turn is placed at the shipyard where it was built.


The map, and colonization:
==========================

* The map is comprised of hexes.
* Each hex covers a lot of space, and may have multiple important locations within it.  Such locations include colonies, worlds (high-development colonies), homeworlds, starbases, outposts, etc.  Each such location is a "zone".  A zone may have multiple things in it.  For instance: the homeworld and the starting outpust are in the same zone.
* Hexes are colonized a planet at a time, using reusable colony ships.  Colony ships require resources to operate.  Colony ships can develop existing colonies (deliver pop), or start new ones.  It takes more resources (maybe longer) to start new colonies.  Colonies consume resources in the early turns, then develop into resource-producers.
* When C1 colonies exist in a hex, and their pop and/or development is above a certain threshold T1, the hex is owned.
* A hex can contain multiple colonies from multiple nations.  Nations can attack and/or force other nations' colonies to move.  More than one nation may "own" a hex.  Each nation may or may not know about other nations' colonies.
* One or more significant worlds may exist within a hex.  Once a colony crosses a certain threshold T2 (> T1), it starts to generate resources (we'll call this a "world").  Each world is a supply node.
* Each province of hexes earns you income.  A province is 6 adjacent hexes.
* Forming a province takes resources.
* The home hex for each nation starts with multiple worlds, an outpost, a reasonably sized fleet of weak ships, and a colony ship.


Supply:
=======

* Supply starts in the home hex, and goes outward from there H1 hexes.  If supply encounters a mobile base, outpost, starbase, or world (a "supply node") owned by the same nation, supply radiates out from that supply node, etc.  Stated another way, a hex is in supply if it can trace a path from itself to the home hex, from supply node to supply node, without ever moving H1 + 1 hexes without reaching a supply node.
* When tracing a supply path, the path is blocked by enemies, and unblocked by friendlies.  TODO!


Ships and fleets:
=================

* Ships should be relatively plentiful.
* Non-combat operations (delivering ground forces, setting up outposts and bases, etc.) must be done by special craft, "lifters".
* Most ships should travel at the same speed: H1 hexes per turn.  H1 should depend on the current tech level.  The Lightest ships should get a bonus on top H1.  The heaviest should get a malus.  This may apply to heavy warships, but must definitely apply to lifters and colony ships.
* When the tech level goes up, a ship must be upgraded to get the new speed H1.  They can do this at a starbase (limit S1 ships/turn), or at the shipyard (unlimited upgrades).  The upgrades cost resources.
* Each ship's tech level in each tech area is listed, along with the current tech level.  For instance, detection may be lited as 3/5 if the ship's detection hardware is level 3, and level 5 has been researched.
* When ships are damaged in combat, they must be repaired at a mobile repair yard (limited to P1 points/turn), or the shipyard (unlimited upgrades).  The repairs cost money.
* Ships must be in supply to operate normally.  If they move outside of supply, their speed and fighting strength are halved (rounding down).  If they move more than H1/2 hexes outside of supply, they are stuck.  If they do not re-enter supply within two turns of that, they are lost.
* Each nation has a ship build schedule; builds are at the main shipyard in the home hex.  It is *extremely* expensive to establish new shipyards, including when the old one is destroyed.  All ships in the schedule may be built at face value.  Any ships in excess of that may only be built in times of war, and for double price.
* The schedule includes a mix of small, medium, and large warships.  It also includes lifters and colony ships.
* There needs to be system for upgrading shipyards to increase the build schedule.  TODO!
* Shipyards appear in the same zone as the starting outpost and homeworld.
* Ships can be organized into fleets.  Fleets can have several missions: Engage, Evade, Intercept, Guard Supply, Planetary attack, and Occupy.  TODO: Pirate mission to steal resources from other nations?  What would counter that?
* Engage is the default.  The fleet will hold its position, and fight any units that enter its hex.
* Evade is like engage, except that the fleet will will try not to fight units that enter its hex.  The fleet must remain undetected for this to work.  The detection chance increases turn by turn for uncloaked ships.
* Intercept: the fleet should move to intercept ships moving toward its hex.  It will intercept them as far away as possible, given the detection done by all friendlies.  This makes it a good idea to have a picket line of small ships out in front of the hex you want to defend.
* Guard supply: the fleet should move to unblock supply to friendlies.  If it has no hex within range at which to do so, it moves to block supply to enemies.  It will move to (un)block the biggest force possible.  Guard supply moves happen after regular moves.  Guard fleets may not be able to reach some hexes that are otherwise within range, due to pinning effects.
* Planetary attack: Kill population on any and all planets within the hex.  Bigger fleets do more damage.  May only be done when at war with the target hex's nation.
* Occupy: spread out and occupy captured territory.  One ship is required per world, and one additional ship is required per province.  Ships will automatically react into clumps when attacked, within the limit of their movement ratings.  May only be done at war.


Other units:
============

* Mobile bases must be built.  They are part of the build schedule.  They can be over-built (for 2x cost, as always).
* Mobile bases must be towed via lifter out to a location.  They are not operational until the beginning of the turn after they are placed.
* A lifter is required to upgrade a mobile base to an outpost.  This takes multiple turns; a second lifter can be used to speed things up.  This upgrade takes resources.
* A lifter is also required to upgrade an outpost to a starbase.  This takes multiple turns; up to two additional lifters can be used to speed things up.  This upgrade takes resources.
* Starbases are always in supply; mobile bases and outposts may or may not be.
* Mobile bases, outposts, and starbases are each supply nodes.
* Ouposts and starbases have fighters.  Fighters can be used in the hex of the base, and can move into an adjacent hex.  In early game, they should not have fighters, and in mid game their fighters should only be usable in their hex.

* Ground units are called divisions.  They exist to protect worlds; they have fighters.  Their fighters can only be used in the hex in which they are based.
* Mobile repair yards exist to repair and upgrade ships in the field, so that they don't have to return to a starbase or the shipyard.  They must be built special, and towed with a lifter like a mobile base.  They may only be built during times of war.


Resources, maintenance, industry, and tech:
===========================================

* Resources are produced by worlds (planets above T2 population).  The amount produced is proportional to the population above T2.  (TODO: Consider sublinear pop growth, and perhaps a sigmoid dampening when reaching some max pop based on that planet's livable area.)
* Resources are split among tech, industry, and maintenance.  If the total amount of resources available is R, Rt + Ri + Rm = R.  (TODO: Consider allowing resources to be banked, lent out, given to, and/or borrowed from, other nations, or internally within one's own economy.  Lending and borrowing imply interest.  Inability to repay loans may result in bankruptcy.)
* Maintenance must be paid for ships, divisions, mobile bases, and outposts.
* Maintenance must be paid for colonies before they reach T1 population.
* Industry is production of ships and other units.  To build everything in the build schedule, the right amount of resources must be supplied.  Provide less ,and everything cannot be built.  Supply more if you want to over-build.
* Resources may also be spent to upgrade the shipyard.  This is effectively an increase to the build schedule.
* Tech consumes resources as well.  Spending on tech increases the per-turn chance of developing a given tech.  The chance starts at 0%, but maxes out at 94%


Tech:
=====

* There are multiple areas of tech: stealth, detection, construction, propulsion, weapons, shields.
* Stealth allows your cloaked variants to avoid detection. (You can build cloaked variants of some ships.)
* Detection allows you to detect cloaked ships, uncloaked ships, and the presence and location of other nations' colonies.
* Construction allows you to build larger and tougher ships and bases.
* Propulsion lets you build faster ships, by increasing your H1.
* Weapons allows you to build more deadly ships and bases.
* Shields allows you to build tougher ships and bases.

* Evaluation of tech effects is typically partially adversarial.  For instance, the chance to detect a cloaked ship is based primarily on the ship's stealth tech level, but is modified by the difference between its stealth level and the detection levels of its adversaries.  As another example, a bonus damage to shields is given if an attacker has a higher weapons tech than the target's shield tech; a bonus damage to the ship itself is given if the attacker's weapon level is higher than the target's construction level.
* A given ship, base, or other unit may be unlocked when certain tech level minimums are met.  In other cases, capabilities are added to existing units.  For instance, when fighters are unlocked, the first carriers are unlocked along with them; starbases get fighters at the same time (they may get them a bit at a time over subsequent tech levels).


Other:
======

* War support is a thing.  It can be manufactured in order to start a war, but when this is done it is not very high at the start of the war.  It is very high at the start of a defensive war.
* War support increases when your population is attacked.
* War support increases when you lose territory -- up to some threshold percentage of your territory, T3.  After that, it falls precipitously.
* War support increases when you win battles, and decreases when you lose them.


Pinning:
========

* At any time during the movement phase, if a fleet is moving and it either moves into a hex containing enemy ships, or it is met by enemy ships that react into its hex via an Intercept mission, it must leave behind a number of ships equal to the number of enemy ships.  The ships left behind are always chosen from lowest to highest combat rating.
